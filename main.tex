\begin{abstract}

    The "Observe, Orient, Decide, Act" (OODA) loop encapsulates the agility of
    cyber-physical or cyber-human systems that depend on continuous iterations
    of these steps. Systems with faster OODA loops react more quickly to
    changes in their environment. This work extends the SteelEagle
    cloudlet-based autonomous drone system to utilize onboard computational
    abilities. We bechmark the OODA loop of the new setup and identify
    opportunities for optimization. We show how to combine the use of onboard
    computational abilities, for tasks that benefit immensely from a faster OODA loop,
    and offloading, for tasks that are more computationally expensive, leading
    to an optimal system that excels in real-time computer visions tasks.

% The other requirements Catherine has:
%
%  - avoid large margins.  She wants the thesis to use fewer pages,
%    especially if it requires colour printing.
%
%  - The thesis should be formatted for double-sided printing.  This
%    means that all chapters, acknowledgements, table of contents, etc.
%    should start on odd numbered (right facing) pages.
%
%  - You need to use the department standard tech report title page.  I
%    have tried to ensure that the title page here conforms to this
%    standard.
%
%  - Use a nice serif font, such as Times Roman.  Sans serif looks bad.
%
% Other than that, just make it look good...
