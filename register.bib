abstract = {Fully autonomous flight by low-cost, lightweight commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) drones could transform many use cases involving real-time computer vision. We show how such autonomy can be achieved using edge computing from a flight platform costing less than $800, and composed of a 320 g COTS drone with a 26 g COTS wearable device as payload. In spite of the extreme austerity of this platform and thermal limits on its LTE transmission, the system is able perform tasks such as detecting and then tracking a target. It is also able to visually navigate around obstacles. Such capabilities are only found on heavier and more expensive drones today.},

abstract = {This position paper examines a spectrum of approaches to overcoming the limited computing power of mobile devices caused by their need to be small, lightweight and energy efficient. At one extreme is offloading of compute-intensive operations to a cloudlet nearby. At the other extreme is the use of fixed-function hardware accelerators on mobile devices. Between these endpoints lie various configurations of programmable hardware accelerators. We explore the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches and conclude that they are, in fact, complementary. Based on this insight, we advocate a software-hardware co-evolution path that combines their strengths.},
