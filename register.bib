abstract = {Fully autonomous flight by low-cost, lightweight commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) drones could transform many use cases involving real-time computer vision. We show how such autonomy can be achieved using edge computing from a flight platform costing less than $800, and composed of a 320 g COTS drone with a 26 g COTS wearable device as payload. In spite of the extreme austerity of this platform and thermal limits on its LTE transmission, the system is able perform tasks such as detecting and then tracking a target. It is also able to visually navigate around obstacles. Such capabilities are only found on heavier and more expensive drones today.},

abstract = {This position paper examines a spectrum of approaches to overcoming the limited computing power of mobile devices caused by their need to be small, lightweight and energy efficient. At one extreme is offloading of compute-intensive operations to a cloudlet nearby. At the other extreme is the use of fixed-function hardware accelerators on mobile devices. Between these endpoints lie various configurations of programmable hardware accelerators. We explore the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches and conclude that they are, in fact, complementary. Based on this insight, we advocate a software-hardware co-evolution path that combines their strengths.},

We discuss how this simple and compact framework has explanatory power and predictive value in reasoning about system design.},

We argue that further steps are needed to develop drones from nice toys to professional tools—from photography and filming applications to inspection services and large cargo logistics. For innovation managers and entrepreneurs, we describe what triggers the emergence of a technology and attracts the needed actors to unleash its transformative potential. Our research is based on industry reports, news, and market studies as well as interviews with four industry actors.}

However, easily partitioning these applications for remote execution while retaining application-specific information has proven to be a difficult challenge. In this paper, we show that automated dynamic repartitioning of mobile applications can be reconciled with the need to exploit application-specific knowledge. We show that the useful knowledge about an application relevant to remote execution can be captured in a compact declarative form called tactics. Tactics capture the full range of meaningful partitions of an application and are very small relative to code size. We present the design of a tactics-based remote execution system, Chroma, that performs comparably to a runtime system that makes perfect partitioning decisions. Furthermore, we show that Chroma can automatically use extra resources in an over-provisioned environment to improve application performance.},

Spectra enables applications to combine the mobility of small devices with the greater processing power of static compute servers. Spectra is self-tuning: it monitors both application resource usage and the availability of resources in the environment, and dynamically determines how and where to execute application components. In making this determination, Spectra balances the competing goals of performance, energy conservation, and application quality. We have validated Spectra's approach on the Compaq Itsy v2.2 andIBMThinkPad 560X using a speech recognizer, a document preparation system, and a natural language translator. Our results confirm that Spectra almost always selects the best execution plan, and that its few suboptimal choices are very close to optimal.},

abstract="This paper is concerned with nature conservation by automatically monitoring animal distribution and animal abundance. Typically, such conservation tasks are performed manually on foot or after an aerial recording from a manned aircraft. Such manual approaches are expensive, slow and labor intensive. In this paper, we investigate the combination of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or ``drones'') with automatic object recognition techniques as a viable solution to manual animal surveying. Since no controlled data is available, we record our own animal conservation dataset with a quadcopter drone. We evaluate two nature conservation tasks: (i) animal detection (ii) animal counting using three state-of-the-art generic object recognition methods that are particularly well-suited for on-board detection. Results show that object detection techniques for human-scale photographs do not directly translate to a drone perspective, but that light-weight automatic object detection techniques are promising for nature conservation tasks.",

abstract = {Unmanned aircraft systems, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles or drones, are becoming increasingly common consumer products; their potential applications to search and rescue operations are becoming ever more apparent. A consumer drone was used to locate a mountaineer after he and his climbing partner were separated while summiting Broad Peak in the Karakoram Mountains of northeastern Pakistan, the world's 12th highest summit. The use of a commercial drone in the search for the missing climber allowed for a quick rescue mission, eliminating the need for a fully mobilized rescue party while significantly reducing the risk to the climbers charged with rescuing him. Without the drone, the rescue party would have faced immense challenges, including a vast search area and altitudes near the limits of human physiologic function. With real-time imagery and global positioning system capabilities, drones may become an invaluable tool in search and rescue operations, helping to reduce response time and maintain the safety of responders at high altitude and in many other types of difficult terrain.}

ABSTRACT = {Surveying threatened and invasive species to obtain accurate population estimates is an important but challenging task that requires a considerable investment in time and resources. Estimates using existing ground-based monitoring techniques, such as camera traps and surveys performed on foot, are known to be resource intensive, potentially inaccurate and imprecise, and difficult to validate. Recent developments in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), artificial intelligence and miniaturized thermal imaging systems represent a new opportunity for wildlife experts to inexpensively survey relatively large areas. The system presented in this paper includes thermal image acquisition as well as a video processing pipeline to perform object detection, classification and tracking of wildlife in forest or open areas. The system is tested on thermal video data from ground based and test flight footage, and is found to be able to detect all the target wildlife located in the surveyed area. The system is flexible in that the user can readily define the types of objects to classify and the object characteristics that should be considered during classification.},
